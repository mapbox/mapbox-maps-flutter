### main

* Add nautical miles scale bar distance unit.

### 2.17.0-rc.1

* [iOS] Fix annotation interaction handlers (tap, drag etc.) not working after annotation update.
* Add the ability to get all annotations from an annotation manager.
* Add `customData` field to annotations to be able to pass user data.

### 2.17.0-beta.1

  > [!NOTE]
  > Version numbering has been updated to align with Mapbox's cross-platform SDK versioning scheme. This release skips from 2.12.0 to 2.17.0-beta.1 to synchronize with other Mapbox SDKs (version x.17.0-beta.1), ensuring consistent version numbers across all platforms.

* Update Maps SDK to v11.17.0-beta.1
* Bump Flutter SDK minimum required version to 3.27.0 and `compileSdk` to 35 on Android.
* Fix memory leaks on Android.

### 2.12.0

> [!NOTE] 
> This release adds support for Android 16KB page size requirements. 

* Update Maps SDK to v11.16.0
  * Maps SDK Android dependency now includes NDK 27 support and [support for 16 KB page sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes).
* Fix multi-touch gestures not working in map widget when being nested in `GestureDetector`.
* Expose `LineLayer.lineCutoutOpacity`, `LineLayer.lineCutoutWidth` and `LineLayer.lineCutoutFadeWidth` to make route lines visible through obstructing 3D buildings and other aboveground features.

### 2.11.0

* Update Maps SDK to v11.15.0
* Fix map events not being called if annotations are presented
* Fix Mapbox expression handling on Android by converting List expressions starting with strings to JSON format. 

### 2.10.0

* Update Maps SDK to v11.14.0
  * Fixed FillExtrusionLayer flickering when transitioning between flat and globe projection
* Fix crash when receiving annotation interactions.
* Introduce new experimental properties: `FillLayer.fillConstructBridgeGuardRail`, `FillLayer.fillBridgeGuardRailColor`, `FillLayer.fillTunnelStructureColor`, `CircleLayer.circleElevationReference`. 
* Introduce `tapEvents` and `longPressEvents` API to the Annotation Managers to handle tap and long press event callbacks for annotations:
  Example usage:
  ```dart
  manager.tapEvents(
    onTap: (annotation) {
      print("Tapped annotation: ${annotation.id}");
    },
  );
  manager.longPressEvents(
    onLongPress: (annotation) {
      print("Long press annotation: ${annotation.id}");
    },
  );
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> As part of this change, `AnnotationOnClickListener` is now deprecated.
> Tap events will now not propagate to annotations below the topmost one. If you tap on overlapping annotations, only the top annotation's tap event will be triggered.

### 2.9.0

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ Breaking changes
> * [Android] When a method returns `StylePropertyValue` the property values will now be typed rather than a string.
> * `PointAnnotation.iconImageCrossFade` has been deprecated and setting a value to it will not have any impact. Use `PointAnnotationManager.iconImageCrossFade` instead.
> * The STANDARD_EXPERIMENTAL style has been removed. Use the STANDARD style instead.

* In this release we fixed a bug in our Android conversion code where the property values in `StylePropertyValue` were being returned as strings rather than their actual type. This fix will cause a behavioral change in the return value of the following methods on Android:
  * `getStyleImportConfigProperties`, `getStyleImportConfigProperty`, `getStyleLayerProperty`, `getStyleSourceProperty`, `getStyleTerrainProperty`, `getStyleLightProperty`.
* Expose new methods for working with style imports: `addStyleImportFromJSON`, `addStyleImportFromURI`, `updateStyleImportWithJSON`, `updateStyleImportWithURI`, and `moveStyleImport`.
* Introduce `dragEvents` API to the Annotation Managers to handle drag event callbacks for annotations:
  * `onBegin`: Called when a drag gesture starts on an annotation.
  * `onChanged`: Called continuously as the annotation is dragged.
  * `onEnd`: Called once the drag gesture completes.

  Example usage:
  ```dart
  manager.dragEvents(
    onBegin: (annotation) {
      print("Drag started for: ${annotation.id}");
    },
    onChanged: (annotation) {
      print("Dragging at: ${annotation.geometry}");
    },
    onEnd: (annotation) {
      print("Drag ended at: ${annotation.geometry}");
    },
  );
* Promote interaction APIs to stable. The following APIs are now stable:
  * `MapboxMap.addInteraction`
  * `MapboxMap.removeInteraction`
  * `MapboxMap.setFeatureStateForFeaturesetDescriptor`
  * `MapboxMap.setFeatureStateForFeaturesetFeature`
  * `MapboxMap.getFeatureStateForFeaturesetDescriptor`
  * `MapboxMap.getFeatureStateForFeaturesetFeature`
  * `MapboxMap.removeFeatureStateForFeaturesetDescriptor`
  * `MapboxMap.removeFeatureStateForFeaturesetFeature`
  * `MapboxMap.resetFeatureStatesForFeatureset`
  * `MapboxMap.queryRenderedFeaturesForFeatureset`
* Move experimental `modelElevationReference` property to `LocationPuck3D`. 
* Fixed an issue where style expressions did not override constant values when both were present.
* [ios] Fix crash when force unwrapping UIImage for point annotations.
* Update MapboxMaps to v11.13.0

### 2.8.0 

* Update geometry conversions on Android to use Longitude, Latitude instead of Latitude, Longitude order. This follows the order used by the GeoJSON Specification and the Turf library.
* [Android] Fix color alpha value conversion.
* Introduce experimental `MapboxMap.startPerformanceStatisticsCollection` / `MapboxMap.stopPerformanceStatisticsCollection` APIs allowing to start / stop collecting map rendering performance statistics.
* Update Maps SDK to 11.12.0

### 2.7.0

* Update Maps SDK to 11.11.0
* Introduce a `setCustomHttpHeader` method to allow the plugin to modify HTTP headers dynamically.
* Experimental `StandardBuildingState` has been removed. Use `StandardBuildingsState` instead.
* `top-image`, `bearing-image`, and `shadow-image` properties on `LocationIndicatorLayer` are now paint properties instead of layout properties.
* Introduce `onZoomListener` to `MapWidget` to allowing listening to zoom events resulting from user gestures: pinching, double-tapping, or quick zooming. The event returns `MapContentGestureContext`, which includes `touchPosition` (the location of the gesture on the screen), `point` (the geographical coordinates of the gesture), and `gestureState` (the state of the gesture). See `gestures_example.dart` for implementation guidance.
* Expose `SymbolLayer.iconSizeScaleRange`, `SymbolLayer.iconSizeScaleRangeExpression`, `SymbolLayer.textSizeScaleRange`, `SymbolLayer.textSizeScaleRangeExpression`, `LineLayer.lineCrossSlope`, `LineLayer.lineElevationReference`, `LineLayer.lineWidthUnit`, `FillLayer.fillElevationReference`.
* Expose `PointAnnotationManager.setIconSizeScaleRange()`, `PointAnnotationManager.getIconSizeScaleRange()`, `PointAnnotationManager.setTextSizeScaleRange()`, `PointAnnotationManager.getTextSizeScaleRange()` , `PolygonAnnotationManager.setFillElevationReference()`, `PolygonAnnotationManager.getFillElevationReference()`, `PolylineAnnotationManager.setLineCrossSlope()`, `PolylineAnnotationManager.getLineCrossSlope()`, `PolylineAnnotationManager.setLineElevationReference()`, `PolylineAnnotationManager.getLineElevationReference()`, `PolylineAnnotationManager.setLineWidthUnit()`, `PolylineAnnotationManager.getLineWidthUnit()` as experimental.
* Mark `ClipLayer.clipLayerScope` and `ClipLayer.clipLayerTypes` as stable
* Mark `BackgroundLayer.backgroundPitchAlignment` as experimental
* [Android] Fix rare NPE upon native view disposal.

### 2.6.0

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The iOS minimum deployment target is now iOS 14.0.

* Update Maps SDK to 11.10.0
* Align tap propagation behavior on Android and iOS.
* Introduce the experimental Interactions API, a toolset that allows you to handle interactions on both layers and basemap features for styles. This API introduces a new concept called `Featureset`, which allows Evolving Basemap styles, such as Standard, to export an abstract set of features, such as POI, buildings, and place labels, regardless of which layers they are rendered on. An `Interaction` can then be targeted to these features, modifying their state when interacted with. For example, you can add a `TapInteraction` to your map which targets the `buildings` `Featureset`. When a user taps on a building, the building will be highlighted and its color will change to blue.

```dart
var tapInteraction = TapInteraction(StandardBuildings(),
    (_, feature) {
  mapboxMap.setFeatureStateForFeaturesetFeature(feature, StandardBuildingsState(highlight: true));
  log("Building group: ${feature.group}");
});
mapboxMap.addInteraction(tapInteraction);
```
Specific changes:
  * Introduce the experimental `MapboxMap.addInteraction` method, which allows you to add interactions to the map.
  * Introduce the experimental `MapboxMap.removeInteraction` method, which allows you to remove interactions from the map using an identifier `mapboxMap.removeInteraction("tap_interaction_poi")`
  * Introduce the ability to add `TapInteraction` and `LongTapInteraction` targeting the map itself.
  * Introduce `TapInteraction` and `LongTapInteraction`, which allow you to add tap and longTap interactions to the map.
  * Introduce `FeaturesetDescriptor` -- and convenience descriptors for `StandardBuildings`, `StandardPOIs`, and `StandardPlaceLabels` -- which allow you to describe the featureset you want `Interactions` to target.
  * Introduce low-level methods for creating and manipulating interactive features: `queryRenderedFeatures`, `querySourceFeatures`, `setFeatureState`, `getFeatureState`, `removeFeatureState`, `resetFeatureState`
* For more guidance with using these new features see `interactive_features_example.dart`.
* Add support for Swift Package Manager.

### 2.5.2

* Bump Maps SDK to 11.9.2

### 2.5.1

* Bump Maps SDK to 11.9.1

### 2.5.0

* Mark `ClipLayer` as stable.
* Updated our generated code to align with iOS and Android platforms. Specifically, the changes:
  * Update experimental `symbolElevationReference` property on `SymbolLayer`.
  * Introduce `backgroundPitchAlignment` property on `BackgroundLayer`.
  * Introduce experimental `fillZOffset` property on `FillLayer`.
  * Introduce experimental `fillExtrusionBaseAlignment` and `fillExtrusionHeightAlignment` properties on `FillExtrusionLayer`.
  * Mark get and set `ZOffset` methods on `PolygonAnnotationManager`, `PolylineAnnotationManager`, and `PointAnnotationManager` as experimental.
  * Mark get and set `symbolElevationReference` methods on `PointAnnotationManager` as experimental.
  * Mark get and set line trim methods on `PolylineAnnotationManager` as experimental.
  * Add a property `emphasisCircleGlowRange` to `LocationIndicatorLayer` to control the glow effect of the emphasis circle – from the solid start to the fully transparent end.
  * Add experimental `ZOffset` properties to `PolylineAnnotationMessenger`, `PolygonAnnotationMessenger`, and `PointAnnotationMessenger`.
  * Introduce `FillExtrusionBaseAlignment` and `FillExtrusionHeightAlignment`, and `BackgroundPitchAlignment` enums.
* Added viewport support to `MapWidget`. Control the camera’s initial position and behavior by specifying a ViewportState subclass in the viewport parameter. This allows for centering on specific locations, following the user’s position, or showing an overview of a geometry. If no viewport is provided, the map uses its default camera settings.
  ```dart
  MapWidget(
    viewport: CameraViewportState(
      center: Point(coordinates: Position(-117.918976, 33.812092)),
      zoom: 15.0,
    ),
  );
  ```

### 2.4.1

* Fix annotation click listeners not working.

### 2.4.0

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Configuring Mapbox's secret token is no longer required when installing our SDKs.

* Update Maps SDK to 11.8.0
* Updated the minimum required Flutter SDK to version 3.22.3 and Dart to version 3.4.4. With the fix for Virtual Display hosting mode on Android in Flutter 3.22, we’ve changed the default map view hosting mode to Virtual Display composition. This update should eliminate the brief visibility of the map after it has been dismissed.
* Introduce experimental property `MapboxMap.styleGlyphURL`. Use this property to apply custom fonts to the map at runtime, without modifying the base style.
* Expose current map's camera state on `CameraChanged` event. [#704](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-flutter/pull/704)

You can now observe the map's camera updates with `onCameraChangeListener`

```dart
onCameraChangeListener(CameraChangedEventData data) {
  print("CameraChangedEventData: timestamp: ${data.timestamp}, cameraState: ${data.cameraState}");
}
```
* Print to console native Maps SDK logs in debug configuration. [#710](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-flutter/pull/710)
Logs are proxied only in debug configuration and can be disabled completely by passing environment flag `MAPBOX_LOG_DEBUG` with false value.
* Fix rare crash in `Snapshotter`. The crash could happen when creating/destroying multiple instances of `Snapshotter` in succession. [#728](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-flutter/pull/728)
* Fix a crash that occurs when the widget state is updated before the platform view is created. [#724](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-flutter/pull/724)
* Fix a crash in Snapshotter when GlyphsRasterizationMode is specified in MapSnapshotOptions. [#738](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-flutter/pull/738)
* Remove `ProxyBinaryMessenger`, instead setup channel with a `messageChannelSuffix`. [#715](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-flutter/pull/715).

# 2.3.0

* Deprecate untyped default constructor of `RenderedQueryGeometry` with typed constructors: `RenderedQueryGeometry.fromList()/fromScreenBox()/fromScreenCoordinate()`.

This change improves type safety and clarity in the code. By using specific constructors, you can ensure that the `RenderedQueryGeometry` is created with the correct type of data, reducing the risk of runtime errors and making the code easier to understand and maintain.

**Example:**

*Before:*
```dart
// Using the untyped default constructor
final geometry = RenderedQueryGeometry(type: Type.SCREEN_COORDINATE, value jsonEncode(screenCoordinate.encode()));
```

*After:*
```dart
// Using a typed constructor
final geometry = RenderedQueryGeometry.fromScreenCoordinate(screenCoordinate);
```
* Expose API to clear map data, and to set options to `TileStore`.

You can now clear temporary map data from the data path defined in the given resource options, which is useful when you want reduce the disk usage or in case the disk cache contains invalid data.
```dart
await MapboxMapsOptions.clearData();
```
And you can now set additional options to a `TileStore`, for example, a maximum amount of bytes TileStore can use to store files., base URL to use for requests to the Mapbox API, or URL template for making tile requests.
```dart
// Set the disk quota to zero, so that tile regions are fully evicted
// when removed.
// This removes the tiles from the predictive cache.
tileStore.setDiskQuota(0);
```
* Add support for partial GeoJSON updates.

Instead of setting a whole new GeoJSON object anew every time a single feature has changed, now you can apply more granular, partial GeoJSON updates.
If your features have associated identifiers - you can add, update, and remove them on individual basis in your ``GeoJSONSource``. This is especially beneficial for ``GeoJSONSource``s hosting a large amount of features - in this case adding a feature can be up to 4x faster with the partial GeoJSON update API.

```dart
mapboxMap.style.addGeoJSONSourceFeatures(sourceId, dataId, features)
mapboxMap.style.updateGeoJSONSourceFeatures(sourceId, dataId, features)
mapboxMap.style.removeGeoJSONSourceFeatures(sourceId, dataId, featureIds)
```
* Fix `StyleManager.getLayer()` failing for `ModelLayer`, `RasterParticleLayer` and `SlotLayer`.
* Expose data-driven properties on annotation managers. Now it's possible to set data-driven properties globally on annotation manager and specify per-annotation overrides.
Previously user had to specify those properties on each annotation and couldn't specify them globally.

In this case each even annotation will have random color, but others will use the global default specified in the annotation manager.
```dart
final circleAnnotationManager = await mapboxMap.annotations.createCircleAnnotationManager();
var annotations = <CircleAnnotationOptions>[];
for (var i = 0; i < 2000; i++){
  var annotation = CircleAnnotationOptions(
    geometry: createRandomPoint(),
    circleColor: (i % 2 == 0) ? createRandomColor() : null,
    );

  annotations.add(annotation);
}
circleAnnotationManager.setCircleColor(Colors.blue.value);
```
* Expose `autoMaxZoom` property for `GeoJsonSource` to fix rendering issues with `FillExtrusionLayer` in some cases.
* Expose experimental `ClipLayer` to remove 3D data (fill extrusions, landmarks, trees) and symbols.
* Deprecate `SlotLayer.sourceId` and `SlotLayer.sourceLayer` as they have no effect in this layer.
* Expose experimental `SymbolLayer.symbolElevationReference` and `SymbolLayer.symbolZOffset`.
* Add missing `@experimental` annotations to `Layer`'s `Expression` properties.
* Remove experimental `model-front-cutoff` property from `ModelLayer`.
* Expose experimental `lineTrimColor` and `lineTrimFadeRange` on `LineLayer` which allow to set custom color for trimmed line and fade effect for trim.
* Add experimental `FillExtrusionLayer.fillExtrusionLineWidth` that can switch fill extrusion rendering into wall rendering mode. Use this property to render the feature with the given width over the outlines of the geometry.
* Add experimental `MapboxMap.setSnapshotLegacyMode()` to help avoiding `MapboxMap.snapshot()` native crash on some Samsung devices running Android 14. `MapboxMap.setSnapshotLegacyMode()` has no effect on iOS.
* Fix build errors when using Flutter SDK 3.24.
* Add `GestureState` to `MapContentGestureContext` to indicate whether gesture has been started, its touches have changed or it has ended.
* Bump Maps SDK to 11.7.0.

### 2.2.0

* Bump Maps SDK to 11.5.0-beta.1

### 2.0.0

#### ⚠️ Breaking changes

##### Leveraging [Turf](https://pub.dev/packages/turf)'s geometries as a replacement for Map<String, Any?>

You now have the convenience of directly initializing annotations with Turf's geometries, eliminating the need for converting geometry to JSON.

##### Geographical position represented by `Point`s

Geographical positions denoted by `Map<String?, Object?>?` are migrated to [`Point`](https://pub.dev/documentation/turf/latest/turf/Point-class.html) type from [turf](https://pub.dev/packages/turf) package.
Pass `Point`s directly instead of converting them to JSON.
*Before:*
```dart
CameraOptions(
    center: Point(
        coordinates: Position(
        -0.11968,
        51.50325,
    )).toJson())
```
*After:*
```dart
CameraOptions(
    center: Point(
        coordinates: Position(
        -0.11968,
        51.50325,
    )))
```

##### Screen and geographical positions in map interaction(gestures) callbacks
`MapWidget`'s `onTapListener`/`onLongTapListener`/`onScrollListener` now receive `MapContentGestureContext` containing both touch position of the gesture, as well as the projected map coordinate corresponding to the touch position.
*Before:*
```dart
onTapListener: { (coordinate)
    final lat = coordinate.x;
    final lng = coordinate.y;
    ...
}
```

*After:*
```dart
onTapListener: { (context)
    final coordinates = context.point.coordinates; // Position
    final touchPosition = context.touchPosition; // ScreenCoordinate
    ...
}
```
##### Creating an annotation with a given geometry
*Before:*
```dart
PointAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: Point(
    coordinates: Position(0.381457, 6.687337)
  ).toJson()
)
PolygonAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: Polygon(coordinates: [
    [
      Position(-3.363937, -10.733102),
      Position(1.754703, -19.716317),
      Position(-15.747196, -21.085074),
      Position(-3.363937, -10.733102)
    ]
  ]).toJson()
)
PolylineAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: LineString(coordinates: [
    Position(1.0, 2.0),
    Position(10.0, 20.0)
  ]).toJson()
)
```

*After:*
```dart
PointAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: Point(
    coordinates: Position(0.381457, 6.687337)
  )
)
PolygonAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: Polygon(coordinates: [
    [
      Position(-3.363937, -10.733102),
      Position(1.754703, -19.716317),
      Position(-15.747196, -21.085074),
      Position(-3.363937, -10.733102)
    ]
  ])
)
PolylineAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: LineString(coordinates: [
    Position(1.0, 2.0),
    Position(10.0, 20.0)
  ])
)
```
##### Snapshots

###### Standalone snapshotter

Show multiple maps at the same time with no performance penalty. With the all new `Snapshotter` you can get image snapshots of the map, styled the same way as `MapWidget`.

The `Snapshotter` class is highly configurable. You can set the final result at the time of construction using the `MapSnapshotOptions`. Once you've configured your snapshot, you can start the snapshotting process.

One of the key features of the `Snapshotter` class is the `style` object. This object can be manipulated to set different styles for your snapshot, as well as to apply runtime styling to the style, giving you the flexibility to create a snapshot that fits your needs.

```dart
final snapshotter = await Snapshotter.create(
  options: MapSnapshotOptions(
      size: Size(width: 400, height: 400),
      pixelRatio: MediaQuery.of(context).devicePixelRatio),
  onStyleLoadedListener: (_) {
    // apply runtime styling
    final layer = CircleLayer(id: "circle-layer", sourceId: "poi-source");
    snapshotter?.style.addLayer(layer);
  },
);
snapshotter.style.setStyleURI(MapboxStyles.STANDARD);
snapshotter.setCamera(CameraOptions(center: Point(...)));

...

final snapshotImage = await snapshotter.start()
```
##### Map widget snapshotting

Create snapshots of the map displayed in the `MapWidget` with `MapboxMap.snapshot()`. This new feature allows you to capture a static image of the current map view.

The `snapshot()` method captures the current state of the Mapbox map, including all visible layers, markers, and user interactions.

To use the snapshot() method, simply call it on your Mapbox map instance. The method will return a Future that resolves to the image of the current map view.

```dart
final snapshotImage = await mapboxMap.snapshot();
```

Please note that the `snapshot()` method works best if the Mapbox Map is fully loaded before capturing an image. If the map is not fully loaded, the method might return a blank image.

* Fix camera center not applied from map init options.
* [iOS] Free up resources upon map widget disposal. This should help to reduce the amount of used memory when previously shown map widget is removed from the widget tree.
* Fix multi-word enum cases decoding/encoding when being sent to/from the platform side.
* [Android] Add Gradle 8 compatibility.
* Introduce experimental `RasterArraySource`, note that `rasterLayers` is a get-only property and cannot be set.
* Introduce `TileCacheBudget`, a property to set per-source cache budgets in either megabytes or tiles.
* Expose `iconColorSaturation`, `rasterArrayBand`, `rasterElevation`, `rasterEmissiveStrength`, `hillshadeEmissiveStrength`, and `fillExtrusionEmissiveStrength` on their respective layers.
* Mark `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setWorldview()` and `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setLanguage()` as experimental.
* Bump Pigeon to 17.1.2
* [iOS] Fix crash in `onStyleImageMissingListener`.
* Deprecate `cameraForCoordinates`, please use `cameraForCoordinatesPadding` instead.
* Add a way to disable default puck's image(s) when using `DefaultLocationPuck2D`. By passing an empty byte array, for example, the following code shows a puck 2D with custom top image, default bearing image and no shadow image.
```dart
mapboxMap?.location.updateSettings(LocationComponentSettings(
    enabled: true,
    puckBearingEnabled: true,
    locationPuck:
        LocationPuck(locationPuck2D: DefaultLocationPuck2D(topImage: list, shadowImage: Uint8List.fromList([]))))
);
```
* Update Maps SDK to 11.4.0.

### 1.1.0

* [Android] Fix `maps-lifecycle` plugin crash with `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Please ensure that the hosting activity/fragment is a valid LifecycleOwner`.
* Mark `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setWorldview()` and `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setLanguage()` as experimental.
* Update Maps SDK to 11.3.0.

### 1.0.0

* Add `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setWorldview()` and `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setLanguage()`. Use this to to adjust administrative boundaries/map language based on the map's audience.

* Add a way to specify custom id for annotation manager(and subsequently its backing layer's and source's ids).
* Add `below` parameter to `createAnnotationManager()`, use this to control the position of the annotation layer in relation to other style layers.
* Add `DefaultLocationPuck2D` type interchangeable with `LocationPuck2D` that allows customization of the default location indicator appearance.
* Add `_AnnotationManager.removeAnnotationManagerById()` allowing to remove annotation manager by its id, without having to store a reference to the manager.
* Fix point annotation image disappearing after update on iOS.
* Bump Pigeon to v16.0.0.
* Updater minimum Flutter SDK version to 3.10.0 and above.
* Update minumum Dart SDK version to 3.0.0 and above.
* Convert `MapboxMapsOptions.setBaseUrl()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.getDataPath()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.setDataPath()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.getAssetPath()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.setAssetPath()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.getTileStoreUsageMode()` and `MapboxMapsOptions.setTileStoreUsageMode()` to static methods.
* Fix 2D puck's opacity not being respected on iOS.
* Make `padding` parameter optional in `MapboxMap.cameraForCoordinateBounds()` and `MapboxMap.cameraForCoordinates()`.
* Fix initial camera options passed to `MapWidget` not being applied on Android.
* Add an example representing a traffic route with color based on traffic volumes using LineLayer and Expression.
* [Android] Fix MapOptions incorrect index access at map creation, leading to map not being created(blank view).
* [Android] Use hybrid composition(HC) as the default platform view hosting mode on Android.
* [Android] Add experimental `androidHostingMode` constructor parameter to `MapWidget`. Use this to change the way platform MapView is being hosted by Flutter on Android. This changes the way map view is composited with Flutter UI, read more on this in [Android Platform Views](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Android-Platform-Views) guide from the Flutter team.
* [iOS] `MapboxMap`: `isGestureInProgress()`, `isUserAnimationInProgress()`, `setConstrainMode()`, `setNorthOrientation()`, `setViewportMode()` and `reduceMemoryUse()` are now available on iOS.
* Add `LogConfiguration` allowing to intercept logs produced by the plugin. Pass your custom `LogWriterBackend` to `LogConfiguration.registerLogWriterBackend()` to redirect logs produced by the mapping engine to your desired destination.
* Add `MapWidget.onResourceRequestListener` that can be used to subscribe to resource requests made by the map.
* [iOS] Re-wire `MapWidget`'s `onScroll` event to be triggered whenever map is being panned instead of triggering it only after pan ends.
* [iOS] Address crashes on iOS happening when user location is being shown.
* Bump platform Maps SDK dependencies to 11.1.0.
