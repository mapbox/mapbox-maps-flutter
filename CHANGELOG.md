### 2.0.0

#### ⚠️ Breaking changes

##### Leveraging [Turf](https://pub.dev/packages/turf)'s geometries as a replacement for Map<String, Any?>

You now have the convenience of directly initializing annotations with Turf's geometries, eliminating the need for converting geometry to JSON.

##### Geographical position represented by `Point`s

Geographical positions denoted by `Map<String?, Object?>?` are migrated to [`Point`](https://pub.dev/documentation/turf/latest/turf/Point-class.html) type from [turf](https://pub.dev/packages/turf) package.
Pass `Point`s directly instead of converting them to JSON.
*Before:*
```dart
CameraOptions(
    center: Point(
        coordinates: Position(
        -0.11968,
        51.50325,
    )).toJson())
```
*After:*
```dart
CameraOptions(
    center: Point(
        coordinates: Position(
        -0.11968,
        51.50325,
    )))
```

##### Screen and geographical positions in map interaction(gestures) callbacks
`MapWidget`'s `onTapListener`/`onLongTapListener`/`onScrollListener` now receive `MapContentGestureContext` containing both touch position of the gesture, as well as the projected map coordinate corresponding to the touch position.
*Before:*
```dart
onTapListener: { (coordinate)
    final lat = coordinate.x;
    final lng = coordinate.y;
    ...
}
```

*After:*
```dart
onTapListener: { (context)
    final coordinates = context.point.coordinates; // Position
    final touchPosition = context.touchPosition; // ScreenCoordinate
    ...
}
```
##### Creating an annotation with a given geometry
*Before:*
```dart
PointAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: Point(
    coordinates: Position(0.381457, 6.687337)
  ).toJson()
)
PolygonAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: Polygon(coordinates: [
    [
      Position(-3.363937, -10.733102),
      Position(1.754703, -19.716317),
      Position(-15.747196, -21.085074),
      Position(-3.363937, -10.733102)
    ]
  ]).toJson()
)
PolylineAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: LineString(coordinates: [
    Position(1.0, 2.0), 
    Position(10.0, 20.0)
  ]).toJson()
)
```

*After:*
```dart
PointAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: Point(
    coordinates: Position(0.381457, 6.687337)
  )
)
PolygonAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: Polygon(coordinates: [
    [
      Position(-3.363937, -10.733102),
      Position(1.754703, -19.716317),
      Position(-15.747196, -21.085074),
      Position(-3.363937, -10.733102)
    ]
  ])
)
PolylineAnnotationOptions(
  geometry: LineString(coordinates: [
    Position(1.0, 2.0), 
    Position(10.0, 20.0)
  ])
)
```
##### Snapshots

###### Standalone snapshotter

Show multiple maps at the same time with no performance penalty. With the all new `Snapshotter` you can get image snapshots of the map, styled the same way as `MapWidget`.

The `Snapshotter` class is highly configurable. You can set the final result at the time of construction using the `MapSnapshotOptions`. Once you've configured your snapshot, you can start the snapshotting process.

One of the key features of the `Snapshotter` class is the `style` object. This object can be manipulated to set different styles for your snapshot, as well as to apply runtime styling to the style, giving you the flexibility to create a snapshot that fits your needs.

```dart
final snapshotter = await Snapshotter.create(
  options: MapSnapshotOptions(
      size: Size(width: 400, height: 400),
      pixelRatio: MediaQuery.of(context).devicePixelRatio),
  onStyleLoadedListener: (_) {
    // apply runtime styling
    final layer = CircleLayer(id: "circle-layer", sourceId: "poi-source");
    snapshotter?.style.addLayer(layer);
  },
);
snapshotter.style.setStyleURI(MapboxStyles.STANDARD);
snapshotter.setCamera(CameraOptions(center: Point(...)));

...

final snapshotImage = await snapshotter.start()
```
##### Map widget snapshotting

Create snapshots of the map displayed in the `MapWidget` with `MapboxMap.snapshot()`. This new feature allows you to capture a static image of the current map view.

The `snapshot()` method captures the current state of the Mapbox map, including all visible layers, markers, and user interactions.

To use the snapshot() method, simply call it on your Mapbox map instance. The method will return a Future that resolves to the image of the current map view.

```dart
final snapshotImage = await mapboxMap.snapshot();
```

Please note that the `snapshot()` method works best if the Mapbox Map is fully loaded before capturing an image. If the map is not fully loaded, the method might return a blank image.

* Fix camera center not applied from map init options.
* [iOS] Free up resources upon map widget disposal. This should help to reduce the amount of used memory when previously shown map widget is removed from the widget tree.
* Fix multi-word enum cases decoding/encoding when being sent to/from the platform side.
* [Android] Add Gradle 8 compatibility.
* Introduce experimental `RasterArraySource`, note that `rasterLayers` is a get-only property and cannot be set.
* Introduce `TileCacheBudget`, a property to set per-source cache budgets in either megabytes or tiles. 
* Expose `iconColorSaturation`, `rasterArrayBand`, `rasterElevation`, `rasterEmissiveStrength`, `hillshadeEmissiveStrength`, and `fillExtrusionEmissiveStrength` on their respective layers. 
* Mark `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setWorldview()` and `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setLanguage()` as experimental.
* Bump Pigeon to 17.1.2
* [iOS] Fix crash in `onStyleImageMissingListener`.
* Deprecate `cameraForCoordinates`, please use `cameraForCoordinatesPadding` instead.
* Add a way to disable default puck's image(s) when using `DefaultLocationPuck2D`. By passing an empty byte array, for example, the following code shows a puck 2D with custom top image, default bearing image and no shadow image.
```dart
mapboxMap?.location.updateSettings(LocationComponentSettings(
    enabled: true,
    puckBearingEnabled: true,
    locationPuck:
        LocationPuck(locationPuck2D: DefaultLocationPuck2D(topImage: list, shadowImage: Uint8List.fromList([]))))
);
```
* Update Maps SDK to 11.4.0.

### 1.1.0

* [Android] Fix `maps-lifecycle` plugin crash with `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Please ensure that the hosting activity/fragment is a valid LifecycleOwner`.

* Update Maps SDK to 11.3.0.

### 1.0.0

* Add `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setWorldview()` and `MapboxMapsOptions.get/setLanguage()`. Use this to to adjust administrative boundaries/map language based on the map's audience.
Read more about [Mapbox worldviews](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/worldview/) and [language support](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/change-language/).
* Add a way to specify custom id for annotation manager(and subsequently its backing layer's and source's ids).
* Add `below` parameter to `createAnnotationManager()`, use this to control the position of the annotation layer in relation to other style layers.
* Add `DefaultLocationPuck2D` type interchangeable with `LocationPuck2D` that allows customization of the default location indicator appearance.
* Add `_AnnotationManager.removeAnnotationManagerById()` allowing to remove annotation manager by its id, without having to store a reference to the manager.
* Fix point annotation image disappearing after update on iOS.
* Bump Pigeon to v16.0.0.
* Updater minimum Flutter SDK version to 3.10.0 and above.
* Update minumum Dart SDK version to 3.0.0 and above.
* Convert `MapboxMapsOptions.setBaseUrl()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.getDataPath()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.setDataPath()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.getAssetPath()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.setAssetPath()`, `MapboxMapsOptions.getTileStoreUsageMode()` and `MapboxMapsOptions.setTileStoreUsageMode()` to static methods.
* Fix 2D puck's opacity not being respected on iOS.
* Make `padding` parameter optional in `MapboxMap.cameraForCoordinateBounds()` and `MapboxMap.cameraForCoordinates()`.
* Fix initial camera options passed to `MapWidget` not being applied on Android.
* Add an example representing a traffic route with color based on traffic volumes using LineLayer and Expression.

* [Android] Use hybrid composition(HC) as the default platform view hosting mode on Android.
* [Android] Add experimental `androidHostingMode` constructor parameter to `MapWidget`. Use this to change the way platform MapView is being hosted by Flutter on Android. This changes the way map view is composited with Flutter UI, read more on this in [Android Platform Views](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Android-Platform-Views) guide from the Flutter team.
* [iOS] `MapboxMap`: `isGestureInProgress()`, `isUserAnimationInProgress()`, `setConstrainMode()`, `setNorthOrientation()`, `setViewportMode()` and `reduceMemoryUse()` are now available on iOS.
* Add `LogConfiguration` allowing to intercept logs produced by the plugin. Pass your custom `LogWriterBackend` to `LogConfiguration.registerLogWriterBackend()` to redirect logs produced by the mapping engine to your desired destination.
* Add `MapWidget.onResourceRequestListener` that can be used to subscribe to resource requests made by the map.
* [iOS] Re-wire `MapWidget`'s `onScroll` event to be triggered whenever map is being panned instead of triggering it only after pan ends.
